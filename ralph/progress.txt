## Wed Jan 14 2026 - US-001: Create Database Schema for Stored Functions

### Implemented
- Created `src/storage/stored_functions.rs` with CREATE_STORED_FUNCTIONS_SQL constant defining the stored_functions table schema
- Added stored_functions module to `src/storage/mod.rs` and re-exported types
- Added imports and functions in `src/executor/ddl.rs` to ensure the table can be created
- Table includes: id (auto-increment primary key), name (text, unique), language (enum check), code (text), created_at/updated_at (timestamps)
- Added indexes on language and name columns for efficient lookup
- Code compiles successfully (typecheck passes)

### Files Changed
- src/storage/stored_functions.rs (new file)
- src/storage/mod.rs
- src/executor/ddl.rs

### Learnings
- Followed existing pattern from functions.rs for system tables
- Used CHECK constraint for language enum validation
- Added re-exports with alias to avoid naming conflicts
